            <h2>Ellen Gleditsch's building</h2>
            <p>
                Situated in a central part of Oslo, Pilestredet 35 is OsloMet's largest building. It is the main building of several courses, 
                including Information Technology, Computerengineering and Applied Computer Technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                At 8 stories plus a basement, the building offers a good amount of classrooms, auditoriums, study spaces, and labs for students. 
                The building also houses a large canteen provided by <a href="https://www.sio.no/mat-og-drikke">SiO</a>, as well as a library and the Makerspace
                where students can use tools provided by the university to create. Additionally, the building contains a gym in the basement, as well as a rock 
                climbing wall in building's main hall.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pilestredet 35 is named after the chemist Ellen Gleditsch (1879-1968) who worked as Marie Curie's assistant and was a professor at the University of Oslo.
                Gleditsch was also a prominent voice for women's rights.
            </p>
            <p>
                The building is easily accessible by several modes of transport. Several tram lines stop just outside the building, and there's only a short walk to 
                either bus or metro. The building's central location also means that it is easily reached by foot from most of Oslo city centre.
