                This case is related to our possible carriers because we must modify collectively our approach to designing infrastructures,
                services, software's and products so to benefit the whole and not only the privileged ones that do nut struggle with any
                barrier whatsoever. The future depends on us engineering landscapes that take in consideration nature, systems that are
                sustainable and that embody as broad inclusion as possible so we can grow a healthier and collectively usable reality.

                Somehow humans when they get all served and easy the struggles move inside themselves. This could be an unintended effect
                of universal design. The growth of credited depts, for example, because of lack of impulsivity control.  
            </p>
            <p>
                To try to benefit all may at the end not benefit anyone in the bigger picture. It might be so that we lose simplicity
                of the joys of life. The overall happiness of human interactions because it all has got digitalized to such a extent
                that its merely machines, bots and complex digital infrastructures that keep all in a constant loop.

                Those that would benefit from this evolution is those that for natures law would not have high chances to survive.
                It is already this way; we already defy "<a href="https://www.livescience.com/474-controversy-evolution-works.html" aria-label="Read more about Darwin's Law">Darwin's Law</a>" of “the survival of the fittest”.

                Hopefully with the evolution of technology and our extraction of energy to sustain this usage we would end up benefiting
                the whole worlds ecosystem for better. Until now we have grown lot of consequential thinking from the historical entrance
                to the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/topic/Industrial-Revolution" aria-label="Read more about the industrial revolution">industrial revolution.</a> Now we know the consequences of fossil fuel to create energy for example. In consequence to
                our modern days advancement in digitalization and technology we believe we will end up patching up most of those destructive
                holes and create more sustainable methods that would relieve natures pressure from our exponential growth of needs.

                Yes, the social consequences are here for most of us to experience. Socially we have moved on to digital platforms to
                socialize. For example, thru social media, gaming platforms, dating apps, forums, etc.. Socially we have changed emojis
                for emotional expressions because we barely need to see each other (does this make us disconnect from our emotions?).
                With <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digitization" aria-label="Read more about digitalization">digitalization</a> our reach is both positively much broader, and negatively shallower. We also must grow our critical
                thinking since to be able to safely navigate the vast ocean of possibilities, where many are fake and some even dangerous.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Economic consequences may be that our credit trap deepens, and the credit cycles get bigger and impossible to solve.
                Historians study these cycles and the cycles seem to repeat over and over again, like for example “the frenzy of expansion
                generated large financial bubbles that burst”(Cairn.inf, 2009). Today we live in a depth crises that is basically impossible
                to fix, but we can try to navigate it through so to damage control the consequences. The digitalization has made this trap 
                even deeper with for example internet scams, impulse control degradation because of easy click buying and constant temptation.
                We would also debate the hollowness that digital social interactions can bring increases the need for rapid and instant
                satisfaction. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation" aria-label="Read more about inflation">inflation</a> that comes with the fall of power fiats like the dollar has also shown us that we may seem to create
                wealth for a period of time, but suddenly it is not sustainable because underlaying it all it is humans that use the digital way
                of living and if our emotions are not of contentment and joy, we will want to supplement this void with superficial goods. Some
                has more power of inquiry, so they buy more then they need for own capitalization, this takes away the chances to people with
                economical barriers. Consequently, destabilizing the whole system that could have the power to bring more equality but that 
                becomes that ground of what is truly happiness and success for all beings, universally speaking.
