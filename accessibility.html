            <h2>Initial design choices</h2>
            <p>
                We began by deciding the layout of the website. We decided on a navigation bar at the top of the page as an easily accessible way to 
                move between the different pages of the website. Subsequequently, we wanted to have margins so that the content of the pages wouldn't 
                be to close to the egdes. As a way of distinguishing both the navigation bar and the margins, we used 
                <a href="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel">Adobe Color</a> to find a set of complimentary colors for our theme. We decided on 
                lighter colours so the website would be more inviting.
            </p>
            <h2>Navigation menu</h2>
            <p>
                We coded the navigation bar to be easy to read and easy to use. The active page is always highlighted with white text so the user knows 
                which page they are on, while hovering over a different page highlights the hyperlink in light grey. For mobile view, we used a burger-menu 
                for a prettier layout and less clutter.
